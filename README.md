# -PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Creating several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data. I will write Pythons scripts using Panda's libraries, the Jupyter notebook, and Matplotlib to creat a variety of charts that showcase the ralationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by tupe of city. The final visualizations will help Pyber improve access to ride-sharing services and determne affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
